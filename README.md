# doubly-circular-linked-list-cpp

Implementation of doubly-circular linked list using c++.

Basic operations are:
    Constructor:            construct an empty list
    Copy Constructor:       create a copy of a list
    Destructor:             delete list from memory
    DoublyNode(class):      to instantiate a new node
    Assignment operator:    overload operator=
    isEmpty:                checks if list is empty
    search:                 checks if item exists in list
    insertAtPosition:       insert item at position
    insertAtEnd:            insert item at the end of list
    insertAtBeginning:      insert item at the beginning of the list
    deleteAtPosition:       deletes the node present at position
    deleteAValue:           deletes the node that contains the item
    deleteBeforeAnElement:  delete the node before the node where data was found
    findAndDelete:          deletes the all the occurrences of an item
    removeFirst:            cuts the first node from the list 
    removeLast:             cuts the last node from the list
    deleteDuplicates:       keeps only the first occurrence of an element in the list
    display:                display the content of the list
    operator<<:             overload operator<<
